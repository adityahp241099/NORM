# debug
V1.0
- Utility for systematic logging.
- Provision to pipe logs to a file.
- Enable or disable to view logs with a single switch.
- Puts timestamp automatically.

## class debug

###### \_\_init\_\_(self, file_out = None)
- file_out:<br>
  Path to store all the logs. If path is not provided , logs wont be stored in any file.

###### log(self,\*args,priority=0,sep=" ",end="\n")
- \*args:(str)<br>
  All the text that needs to be logged , just like using <b>print()</b> function.
- priority:(int)<br>
  If the set priority of the class is greater than the priority that is given, log wont stored.
- sep:(str)<br>
  To put a seperator between the different args.
- end:(str) <br>
  All the logs generated by the class object will end with this string.

Note: To disable logging in to the shell, set debug.console to False

Usage:
```python
from DebugUtilities import debug
logger = debug.debug('main.log')
logger.log('Hello')
##Hello will be logged into both shell and main.log file
logger.priority = 5
logger.log('Hello',priority = 3)
#This wont be logged
logger.log('Hello',priority = 6)
#This will be logged in both shell and main.log file
logger.console = False
logger.log('Hello',priority = 6)
#This will be logged in only main.log file
```
Note: Multiple logger instances can be created to filter out the logs module wise.
